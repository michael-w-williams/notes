### Json Syntax
Is there a difference between json and js

json
```json
[{"birthDate":"1970-11-28T08:28:48.078Z","department":"Mobility","email":"Hugh.Jast@example.com","firstName":"Hugh","id":"48cf06ad-6ed4-47e6-ac44-3ea9c67cbe2d","lastName":"Jast","phone":"730-715-4446","title":"National Data Strategist"}]
```

js
```js
[{"birthDate":"1970-11-28T08:28:48.078Z","department":"Mobility","email":"Hugh.Jast@example.com","firstName":"Hugh","id":"48cf06ad-6ed4-47e6-ac44-3ea9c67cbe2d","lastName":"Jast","phone":"730-715-4446","title":"National Data Strategist"}]
```

Clearly there is no difference.
